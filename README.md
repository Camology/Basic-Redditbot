# Basic-Redditbot
Basic boilerplate for a reddit bot


Register a new account, go to preferences > apps > create an app, register it as a script and then let it go wild

does require praw which you can install through pip. if you dont know how to do this then google it its easy

Should probably update this to do some exception handling one day
